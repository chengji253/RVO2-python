# Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance

ORCA is a classic multi-robot collision avoidance method, but the official C++ code is not very convenient for debugging and porting. Therefore, we have developed a Python version of the ORCA implementation.

This code is written strictly in accordance with the official author's code, ensuring its correctness and reliability.


## Features
- Strictly follows the algorithm logic of the official C++ version, ensuring correctness
- Python implementation, easy to debug and port
- Simple API, convenient for third-party application integration
- Supports collision avoidance simulation for multi-robot scenarios
